## Overview
This is a desktop website for an elegant watch business. The design can be described as simple elegance with contrasts of black, grey and white.  This classy layout includes eye catching graphics of individuals and products.  It is easy on the eye and keeps you focused on the product, rather than the gymnastics of a fancy website.
Because of his straightforward layout and design, Gabriel provided an easy path to develop this website. 
### The challenge
- Develop a React landing page designed by one of our fellow UX design apprentices. 

### Designs
####[Figma Project Here]( https://www.figma.com/file/e2UCelVPh3pfoIw26nrNDb/Desktop-Webpage?node-id=101%3A2)

### Links
- Solution URL: (https://github.com/kevinh21/watches.git)

## My process
I reviewed the design and determined the layout contained a Hero, four rows, and a footer component.  Within each component there were various graphics, navigation, and fonts to be considered. 
### Built with
- Custom CSS 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned
It was obvious from the design that Gabriel kept the work required by the developer in mind.  Discussing the purpose and ideas behind the project, it became clear that knowledge of development process was important in making sure the project could be accomplished in a short timeframe.   When a designer also has even a little knowledge or experience with development, designs can be more realistic while presenting and very nice look.
In this project access to the artifacts I Figma.com were essential to nearly exact replication of the desired design.   Conveying the ideas about layout can be very detailed and yet simple to follow.
Once the functionality and design tools of Figma were understood, it was a simple process of following the layout values that were presented in the design.
